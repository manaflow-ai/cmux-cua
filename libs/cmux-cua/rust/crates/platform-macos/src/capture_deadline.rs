//! Bounded waits for ScreenCaptureKit and other screen-capture calls.
//!
//! ScreenCaptureKit (and the legacy CoreGraphics / `screencapture` capture
//! paths, which macOS routes through the same capture service) can block
//! forever: a system consent alert, a "bypass the private window picker"
//! prompt, or a wedged `replayd` leaves the completion handler pending with
//! no error. A tool request that awaits such a call must not hang with it.
//!
//! [`bounded`] runs one capture operation on a dedicated worker thread and
//! waits at most `budget` on an injectable [`CaptureClock`]. When the budget
//! elapses, the caller gets a typed [`CaptureTimeout`] and the worker is
//! abandoned: when the system call eventually returns, its value goes to the
//! `on_late` handler (for example to stop a stream that started too late) or
//! is dropped. The caller is answered exactly once, and a late completion
//! never touches the caller's state.
//!
//! A blocked system call cannot be cancelled, so an abandoned worker thread
//! stays parked until macOS answers. [`MAX_ABANDONED_WORKERS`] caps how many
//! such threads can exist; past the cap a new capture fails immediately with
//! the same typed error instead of spawning another stuck thread.
